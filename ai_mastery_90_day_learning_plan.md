## Phase 1: Personal Knowledge RAG System (Days 1-30)

**Project Goal:** Build "Ask George" - a queryable knowledge base from Granola meetings, Google Docs, and emails.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) works
- Vector embeddings and semantic search
- Vector databases (ChromaDB/Pinecone)
- Chunking strategies for different content types
- Claude API basics and context management

### Week 1: Foundations (Days 1-7)

#### Day 1-2: Understanding Embeddings ✅ COMPLETED
**Day 1:** ✅
- [x] Read Anthropic's embeddings documentation
- [x] Create Python script to generate embeddings for 10 sample sentences
- [x] Calculate similarity scores between sentences
- [x] Answer: Why does semantic similarity work without shared words?
- **File:** `understanding_embeddings.py`
- **Key Learning:** Use dedicated embedding models (sentence-transformers), not chat models

**Day 2:** ✅
- [x] Export 1 Granola meeting transcript
- [x] Split transcript into chunks: 100, 500, 1000 tokens
- [x] Embed each version and test retrieval quality
- [x] Document findings on optimal chunk size
- **File:** `understanding_chunking.py`
- **Key Learning:** Chunk size is an art, not a science. For "Ask George": 1000 tokens optimal (1 chunk per topic in 30-min meetings)

**Setup Requirements:**
```bash
pip install anthropic numpy scikit-learn
```

#### Day 3-4: First Vector Database

**Day 3:** ✅
- [x] Install ChromaDB: `pip install chromadb`
- [x] Create a collection
- [x] Add chunks from meeting transcript
- [x] Query with test questions
- [x] Return top results
- **File:** `understanding_chromadb.py`
- **Key Learning:** ChromaDB provides persistence, auto-embedding, and optimized search. Uses all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dimensions) by default. Distance metric (lower = better) vs similarity (higher = better).

**Day 4:** ✅
- [x] Add metadata to chunks (date, meeting type, participants)
- [x] Implement filtered queries
- [x] Test filtered queries with `where` parameter
- [x] Document metadata strategy
- **File:** `understanding_chromadb.py` (updated)
- **Key Learning:** Hybrid search = filter by structured metadata + semantic search. Participants most valuable (proxy for topic/project context).

#### Day 5-7: End-to-End RAG Pipeline

**Day 5:** ✅
- [x] Set up Claude API integration
- [x] Build basic RAG flow:
  - User question → Retrieve chunks → Build context → Claude generates answer
- [x] Test RAG vs non-RAG answers
- [x] Implement multi-turn conversation with history
- **File:** `understanding_rag.py`
- **Key Learning:** RAG grounds LLM answers in YOUR data, preventing hallucination. Retrieved 2 chunks (8,011 chars) and Claude answered from context only.

**Day 6:** ✅
- [x] Add citations to RAG responses (include metadata in context)
- [x] Improve prompts to request source attribution
- [x] Test with 4 different question types
- [x] Document what works vs doesn't
- **File:** `understanding_rag.py` (updated with citations)
- **Key Learning:** RAG excels at factual questions (who/what/when) but struggles with judgment questions requiring external criteria. Citations enable verification and follow-ups.

**Day 7:** ✅
- [x] Week 1 retrospective completed
- [x] Identified key takeaways: embeddings → vectors → comparison, tokens, model specialization
- [x] Decided on Week 2 direction: Migrate to Firestore Vector Search for production patterns
- [x] Planned Week 2 day-by-day (Firestore fundamentals → vector search → RAG migration)

**Week 1 Success Criteria:**
- [x] Working Python script answering questions about meetings
- [x] Vector database with real meeting data
- [x] 5-10 test questions returning decent answers (tested 4 different question types)
- [x] Documentation of learnings and improvements needed

---

### Week 2: Data Ingestion → REVISED: Firestore Migration (Days 8-14)

**REVISION NOTE (2025-10-09):** Changed from ChromaDB to Firestore Vector Search for production-ready infrastructure. Google Docs integration deferred to Week 3. Core goals (multiple transcripts, ingestion pipeline, persistent storage, metadata) remain the same.

#### Day 8-10: Firestore Setup & Migration

**Day 8: Firestore Fundamentals** ✅
- [x] Understood NoSQL fundamentals: "Not Only SQL" - flexible, hierarchical, denormalized
- [x] Learned Firestore data model: collections → documents → subcollections → documents
- [x] Chose subcollections over flat structure (delete meeting = delete chunks automatically)
- [x] Created understanding_firestore.py with basic CRUD operations
- [x] Tested: Created meeting document, read it back, added chunk as subcollection
- **Key Learning:** NoSQL = flexible schema, denormalization acceptable, hierarchical data model perfect for meetings → chunks
- **File:** `understanding_firestore.py`

**Day 9: Firestore Vector Search Basics** ✅
- [x] Learned to store embeddings as `Vector` type (not arrays)
- [x] Created vector index via gcloud CLI (384 dimensions, flat index)
- [x] Implemented similarity search with `find_nearest()`
- [x] Tested: Query "Who talked about battleships?" → Found matching chunks
- [x] Understood index trade-offs: Slower inserts, faster searches
- **Key Learning:** Vector type required for search, indexes created via CLI, manual embedding generation (vs ChromaDB auto)
- **File:** `understanding_firestore_vectors.py`

**Day 10: Migrate Chunking + Embeddings Pipeline** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Pivoted to GitHub PR data instead of meeting transcripts (more practical)
- [x] Built PR chunking functions: overview, files, reviews
- [x] Generated embeddings with sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- [x] Stored PR #7974 with 5 chunks in Firestore (prs/{pr_number}/chunks/{chunk_id})
- [x] Created vector index via gcloud CLI
- [x] Tested vector search: "Who reviewed this PR about baseline tables?" → success!
- **Key Learning:** End-to-end cloud RAG pipeline with real GitHub PR data works!

#### Day 11-12: RAG Pipeline & Ingestion

**Day 11: RAG Query Pipeline with Firestore** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Built retrieve_chunks() with vector search from Firestore
- [x] Added smart filtering: date_range, author, reviewer parameters
- [x] Two-stage retrieval: Filter PRs by metadata → vector search within filtered results
- [x] Built build_context() to format chunks with PR metadata
- [x] Connected to Claude API with ask_claude() function
- [x] Tested end-to-end: "What did BenWu review last 2 weeks?" → natural language answer with citations
- [x] Supports three use cases: time-based, asset-based, person-based queries
- **Key Learning:** Hybrid search (metadata filter + vector search) scales better than pure vector search
- **File:** `understanding_firestore_rag.py`

**Day 12: Ingestion Pipeline + Duplicate Detection** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Built `pr_exists()` function to check if PR already in Firestore
- [x] Created `ingest_pr_with_duplicate_check()` for smart ingestion
- [x] Tested with 5 PRs: detected duplicates vs new PRs correctly
- [x] Verified idempotent ingestion (can run multiple times safely)
- [x] Metadata already in place from Day 10 (PR number, author, merged_at, state)
- **Key Learning:** Idempotent ingestion prevents wasted compute/cost. Check `.exists` property on document reference. Production pattern: check before processing expensive operations (chunking, embeddings).
- **File:** `understanding_ingestion.py`

#### Day 13-14: Multiple Transcripts + Testing

**Day 13: Batch Processing**
